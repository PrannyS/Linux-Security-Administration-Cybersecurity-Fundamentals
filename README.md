# Linux-Security-Administration-Cybersecurity-Fundamentals
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview 
This project focuses on essential Linux security administration techniques, crucial for system hardening, security monitoring, and incident response. It includes user & group management, access control, file encryption, system logging, port scanning, and automated security tasks with Bash scripting.

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with real-world Linux security scenarios, including investigating security incidents, securing system access, and automating security-related tasks.

## Key Topics Covered
**User & Group Management**
- User & Group Creation: Managed users and groups using useradd, passwd, and groupadd.
- Privilege Management: Followed the principle of least privilege by restricting user access.
- User Switching & Privilege Escalation: Used su and sudo for controlled privilege elevation.

**Access Control & Privilege Management**
- Permission Modification: Used chmod, chown, and usermod to control file/directory access.
- Restricted Access: Prevented unauthorized users from modifying sensitive files.
- Ownership & Permission Audit: Identified misconfigurations in file permissions.

**Security Logging & Incident Response**
- Syslog Analysis: Monitored system logs for failed login attempts and security warnings.
- Log Filtering: Used grep, awk, sed, and sort to extract relevant security events.
- Incident Detection: Identified duplicate and suspicious log entries.

**File & Disk Encryption**
- Full Disk Encryption (FDE): Implemented encryption at the disk level for enhanced security.
- File-Level Encryption: Used eCryptfs to encrypt and protect sensitive files.

**Port Scanning & Network Security**
- Identified Open Ports: Used netstat and lsof to find open ports.
- Reduced Attack Surface: Identified unnecessary running services and closed them.

**Automating Security Tasks with Bash Scripting**
- Automated Log Filtering: Created scripts to extract security-related log data.
- Scheduled Security Checks: Used cron jobs to automate log analysis.

**Secure Authentication with SSH Key-Based Access**
- Used SSH Key Authentication: Established secure SSH connections without passwords.
- Transferred Private Keys Securely: Used scp to move SSH keys between systems.
